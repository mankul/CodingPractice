/*
 * [200~Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi. A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:
 *
 * Either it is the first day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on each of the previous days.
 * Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.
 * Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
 * Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Vi and represents the number of visitors on the i-th day.
 *
 * Output
 * For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of record breaking days.
 *
 * Limits
 * Time limit: 20 seconds.
 * Memory limit: 1 GB.
 * 1â‰¤Tâ‰¤100.
 * 0â‰¤Viâ‰¤2Ã—105, for all i.
 * Test Set 1
 * 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤1000.
 * Test Set 2
 * 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤2Ã—105, for at most 10 test cases.
 * For the remaining cases, 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤1000.4
